This repo is filled with codewars challenges, known on the site as kata. Currently ranked top 14% on the site. I try to complete a challenge everyday and atleast 5 in a week from either leetcode or codewars. The challenge difficulty increases as you go from high kyu to low kyu.

You may see me use any of the programming languages that I know but most of the times I use Javascript or Typescript.

## Optimizations: 

I often refactor and optimize my code, sometimes for efficiency, sometimes for readability.

## Lessons Learned: 

The Biggest Lesson I learned in tackling this endless supply of questions is understanding that not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve. 

Another lesson was reading and understanding other programmers' solutions helps improve your own ability.
