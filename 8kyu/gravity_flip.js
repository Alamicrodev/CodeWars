// Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity.

// There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.

// +---+                                       +---+
// |   |                                       |   |
// +---+                                       +---+
// +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
// |   ||   |     |   |   -->        |   ||   ||   |
// +---++---+     +---+              +---++---++---+
// +---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+
// |   ||   ||   ||   |         |   ||   ||   ||   |
// +---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+

// Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the n columns after Bob switches the gravity.

const flip=(d, a)=>{
    flippedValues = undefined; 
    if (d == "R"){
      flippedValues = a.sort((a,b) => a-b)
    }
    else 
      {
        flippedValues = a.sort((a,b) => b-a)
      }
    return flippedValues
  }
