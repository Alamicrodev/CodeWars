// Note: This challenge is extremely easy, the only reason I am doing this is because I am a messi fan lol

// Messi is a soccer player with goals in three leagues:

// LaLiga
// Copa del Rey
// Champions

// Complete the function to return his total number of goals in all three leagues.

// Note: the input will always be valid.

// For example:
// 5, 10, 2  -->  17

// -------------------- My Solution -----------------------------------

function goals (laLigaGoals, copaDelReyGoals, championsLeagueGoals) {
    let totalGoals = laLigaGoals+copaDelReyGoals+championsLeagueGoals
    return totalGoals
  }
